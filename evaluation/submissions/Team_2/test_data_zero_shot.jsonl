A good zoo helps these animals live and have babies in a safe place. Also, when there are fewer wild animals, there is a bigger risk that their groups become too similar genetically.

However, another group felt their intelligence was being judged, and they had failed. They had a 'fixed mindset', believing they could not get smarter. Some of these children even considered cheating, while others tried to find someone who had performed worse to feel better about themselves."}

However, one thing we can observe in the remains of early humans is the development of their mouth, throat, and tongue.
