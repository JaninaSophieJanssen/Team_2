{"text_id": "15-a2", "simplified": "We think Girox Foods should manage its workers in a better way. They should let workers choose when they work. They should also let workers work from home or other places. Bosses should give workers interesting tasks and tell them when they do good work. Girox Foods should also help workers learn new skills, especially how to talk to people from different countries. This will make workers happy and help them do their best work."}
{"text_id": "15-b1", "simplified": "Based on our findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a management style that focuses more on its people. This means they should explore offering more flexible working hours to their employees. They should also consider how employees can work from their chosen locations. Managers need to find different ways to challenge staff and give them more positive feedback and recognition for their work. Investing more in training, especially in social and intercultural communication, could also help create a positive environment for employees to do their best work."}

This meant that fewer children died when they were young, which caused the world's population to grow quickly.

But we must not use stereotypes. Stereotypes are bad ideas about groups of people. They can hurt business relationships. Many things make us who we are: our country's culture, where we live, our friends, our age, if we are a man or a woman, our work culture, and what we have learned in life. So, we should remember that people can be different, but we should not put them into simple groups just because of their country."}
{"text_id": "17-b1", "simplified": "Understanding that people from different cultures may have different expectations and ways of behaving can help us avoid misunderstandings. However, it is very important to remember that using cultural stereotypes can damage good business relationships. Although national cultures can influence how we act and think, we are also greatly shaped by the region we come from, the communities we belong to, our age, gender, our company's culture, and our personal experiences. Therefore, we should be aware of potential differences, but we should not use them to unfairly categorize individuals from an entire nation."}
