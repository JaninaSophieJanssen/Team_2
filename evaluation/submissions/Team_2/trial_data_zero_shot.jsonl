{"text_id": "01-b1", "simplified": "NASA is working to find and track smaller asteroids, specifically those that are 140 meters wide or larger. Experts believe there are about 25,000 such asteroids. However, only about 8,000 have been found and recorded so far, leaving 17,000 still unknown. For example, in 2013, a 19-meter asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, injuring 1,200 people. This shows that these medium-sized asteroids could be a serious threat if they enter Earth's orbit."}

Other times, the bridge was only built to hold a specific amount of weight. If too much weight is put on it, it can collapse."}

This means we should explore options for offering staff more flexible working hours. We should also consider allowing employees to work from locations they prefer. Managers need to find various ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive feedback and recognition for their work. Investing more in professional development, especially in social and intercultural communication, could also help create a positive environment where employees can perform their best."}
